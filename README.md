# Welcome to C programming

## What is C?.
`C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
 It is a very popular language, despite being old.
 C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write.`
 
 ### My First C program
 ```
 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
} 
```
 
 ### C programming topics to be covered
 * C Syntax                                            * C Constants
 * C output                                            * C Operators
 * Comments                                            * If Else Statements
 * Variables                                           * C Switch
 * Datatypes                                           * While loops
 * For loops                                           * C Break / Continue
 * Functions                                           * Arrays
 * Strings                                             * User Input
 * Memory Address                                      * Pointers

| Project Name  | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| [0x00-hello_world](https://github.com/sethdanny/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world)| Contains Tasks about introduction to c programming |
|[0x01-variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/sethdanny/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while)| contains project tasks about comments, Data types, Integer types, Declaration, Characters, Arithmetic operators, Variables assignments, Comparisons, Logical operators, if, if…else, while loops |
|[0x02-functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/sethdanny/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops)| Contains projects about declaration of functions, nested while and for loops and also the creation of header files to store function prototypes. |
|[0x03-debugging](https://github.com/sethdanny/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging) | Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually |
