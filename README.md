                                                    ---------------------------
## What is C?.
`C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
 It is a very popular language, despite being old.
 C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write.`
 
 ### My First C program
 ```
 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
} 
```
